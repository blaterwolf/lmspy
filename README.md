### Domain Description
A school library has to keep track of the status of all books in the library whether it is quality or quantity. It tracks all the available and unavailable books that a student can borrow with information related to the books and the borrower. It can also be able to add and edit student and book information. As a student borrows a book, it will generate the book information and the date that they borrowed it and the potential return date. If the student failed to return the book in a given date (letâ€™s say 7 days), they will be given a penalty for overdue books and will be given a fine that is calculated. When the student returns the book, they will input the return date and the current condition of the book and if there is a fine, it will show how much the fine will be so that they can pay for it. Each borrowed book is linked to the relevant information which is: Who is the borrower, what date did the borrower borrowed it and what is the due date.
